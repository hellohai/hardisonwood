				<p>If you’re returning to college this fall, you aren’t a newbie anymore. You’re no stranger to the college life, and you understand what it takes to make it on your own. Nevertheless, experience doesn’t immunize you from the risks that all students face on campus.</p>

				<p class="intro-para">You might be a returning student, but you aren’t invulnerable. That’s why the <a href="http://www.hardisonwood.com/lawyers-raleigh/">Law Office of D. Hardison Wood</a> is offering our advice on how even the most experienced students can stay safe and productive this year.</p>

				<ul class="list">
					<li><strong>Stay humble.</strong> It’s easy for returning students to feel somewhat invincible around campus. However, you are not exempt from safety threats, and you should remain cautious and vigilant at all times.</li>
					<li><strong>Act with the future in mind.</strong>  As your college career progresses, each decision you make has a more significant impact on your future. Investing in your future success will keep you focused and can help you avoid unfavorable situations. </li>
					<li><strong>Join a club.</strong> Have a hobby? Chances are your school has some sort of group or organization full of people who enjoy the same things you do. Joining a club can help you meet people with similar interests and establish healthy, long-lasting relationships.</li>
					<li><strong>Befriend your professors.</strong> Not only do professors grade you – but many have the connections to help you network for jobs or recommend you for other important opportunities, such as internships and scholarships. Moreover, a strong bond with your professor can motivate you to do even better in class.</li>
